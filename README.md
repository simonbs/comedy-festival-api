Scrapes shows for the Comedy Festival and serves the shows through an endpoint. Use it together with [this small app](https://github.com/simonbs/comedyfestival) and you are in for a treat.

## Disclaimer

This project is in not associated with Zulu Comedy Festival. This year there is no official app for the comedy festival but I like to browse the line up for the festival on my phone. Therefore I made a teeny tiny app.
